# CO2403-AR-app
This is a 2nd Year University group assignment. The assignment was to utilise emerging augmented reality technologies for use as an 
assistive technology. 
The application is aimed at young people with visual impairment. It is a remake of the classic card game ‘snap’, 
whereby the characters on the card are augmented to assist those with visual impairment.
